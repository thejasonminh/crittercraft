# Purpose
Crittercraft is a virtual pet simulation game where users can select (sheep, duck, panda) and customize (name and colour) their character. In this virtual environment, each pet is presented with health, hunger, and love statistics. Through random events, the character loses health, hunger, and love points over time, encouraging the user to take care of their pet through the care button. To increase the maximum health, hunger, and love points a pet can have, users can play games: memorize me, tictacbone, and guessing hearts respectively. The game ends if the petâ€™s health, hunger, or love goes to zero.
